## This is a TabletopTweaks mod and requires [TabletopTweak-Core](https://github.com/Vek17/TabletopTweaks-Core/releases).

This module provides non tabletop based tweaks to Owlcat's original mythic content including changes to some mythic classes and some mythic abilities.

Once a game is saved with this mod is enabled it will require this mod to be present to load so do not remove or disable the mod once enabled. You can however disable any feature of the mod at will without breaking saves.

All changes are configurable and can be disabled via the unity mod manager menu.
